## Notes üìù
The most challenging part of this project was getting the **comment functionality** to work correctly. I struggled with linking comments to their corresponding posts through the `post_id`. Initially, comments would either store a null value or appear on every post, rather than being correctly tied to the post they were meant for. After some debugging and adjusting the Supabase tables, I successfully resolved the issue, making the comment system functional.
